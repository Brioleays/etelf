                        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                           We are a compassionate, client-focused law firm based in Fort Pierce, Florida, with offices serving families across the Treasure Coast.

                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                          
                            As a sixth-generation Floridian raised in Stuart, I’ve always had a deep love for our community, our waterways, and the beauty of Florida’s natural environment. That same respect for roots and legacy shapes how I approach the practice of law today.

                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                            I grew up watching my father practice law in a way that was anything but ordinary. He believed that when someone needed help, payment could come in many forms, whether it was flowers, sugarcane, or even chickens. From him, I learned that being a lawyer isn’t just about handling cases; it’s about standing by people when they need it most.

                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                            When I joined my father in 2001 to focus on estates and trusts, I carried those lessons with me. I saw firsthand that true advocacy goes beyond drafting documents; it means being prepared to stand up for clients, protect their families, and shield them from the challenges life can bring.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600 leading relaxed">
                            Aging and long-term care can place enormous strain on families if there isn’t a clear, well-crafted plan in place. Without guidance, the costs and consequences can be overwhelming. That’s why my team and I make it our mission to be more than just attorneys, we are your advocates, allies, and protectors.


                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600 leading relaxed">
                           
                        To empower families, I regularly host free educational seminars where we provide the tools, strategies, and insights you need to make informed decisions for yourself and your loved ones.

                            My goal is simple: to make planning for the unexpected easier, clearer, and more secure, so you can focus on living life with peace of mind.
